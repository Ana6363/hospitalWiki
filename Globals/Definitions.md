# Definition of Ready (DoR)

The Definition of Ready ensures that a user story or task is fully prepared to be worked on by the team. A user story or task is considered ready when the following criteria are met:

## 1. Clarity
- The user story or task is clearly written with no ambiguity.
- Acceptance criteria are explicitly defined and well-documented.
- Any dependencies or blockers are identified and either resolved or documented.

## 2. Context
- The story/task aligns with the overall project goals and priorities.
- It has been reviewed and approved by the product owner or stakeholders.

## 3. Estimable
- The scope of the work is small enough to be estimated (fits within one sprint or iteration).
- The team agrees on the effort required (story points, time, or complexity).

## 4. Dependencies
- All necessary dependencies (e.g., APIs, data models, libraries, designs) are either ready or mocked for development.
- External systems, tools, or teams are prepared to support the story/task if required.

## 5. Design & Documentation
- Wireframes, mockups, or workflows (if applicable) are provided and reviewed.
- Relevant documentation (e.g., APIs, database schemas, user personas) is available and accessible.

## 6. Testability
- Acceptance criteria are testable and measurable.
- A clear testing plan (unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests) is outlined.
- Test data or environments required for validation are available.

## 7. Team Agreement
- The development team has reviewed and agreed that the story/task is ready to be started.
- The task is prioritized in the sprint backlog.

# Definition of Done (DoD)

The Definition of Done ensures that a user story or task is fully completed and meets the required quality standards. A user story or task is considered done when the following criteria are satisfied:

## 1. Development
- All code is written, reviewed, and merged into the appropriate branch (following coding standards and guidelines).
- Unit tests are implemented and passed with sufficient coverage (agreed-upon % threshold).
- Integration points (e.g., APIs, databases) are implemented and validated.

## 2. Testing
- Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests pass successfully.
- The feature is tested on staging or a test environment and verified against acceptance criteria.
- Regression testing is conducted, ensuring no new issues are introduced.

## 3. Documentation
- Code is adequately documented (inline comments and external documentation as required).
- User-facing documentation (e.g., user manuals, API documentation) is updated or created.
- Deployment steps or release notes are documented if required.

## 4. Quality Assurance
- Peer code reviews are conducted, and any feedback is resolved.
- The story/task passes all quality gates (e.g., SonarQube, linting, performance benchmarks).

## 5. Performance
- The feature is optimized for performance based on project standards.
- Relevant performance benchmarks (e.g., response time, memory usage) are met.

## 6. Security
- Security vulnerabilities are addressed (e.g., input validation, authentication checks).
- The feature passes security checks and conforms to relevant compliance standards.

## 7. Integration
- The feature is successfully integrated into the application without breaking existing functionality.
- Any changes to shared components or modules are communicated and coordinated with other teams.

## 8. Approval
- The product owner or relevant stakeholders approve the story/task after review.

## 9. Deployment
- The feature is deployed to production or ready for deployment (based on the sprint goal).
- Deployment scripts or configurations (if applicable) are validated and versioned.

## 10. Post-Deployment
- Post-deployment validation (e.g., smoke testing) is completed.
- Monitoring or logging for the feature is enabled (if applicable).
- Feedback or bugs reported during deployment are addressed.
